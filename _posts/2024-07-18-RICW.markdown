The Brits do have one culinary feat I appreciate, and that's how regular it is to serve fresh waffles with their ice creams and gelatos. Not waffle cones, though they have those as well, but real fluffy waffles. I will update this page with in-depth reviews but right now am just testing my ability to embed images!
