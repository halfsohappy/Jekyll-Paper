I've been open about my distaste for British food and the way British "people" interact with it. It seems these people's proudest achievement in the culinary sphere is something called the "Tesco Meal Deal", where you pay £5 and can pcik out a main, side, and drink. A "main" is a palm sized sandwich without crusts, similar to what a child would pack for lunch in the first grade. A "side" is a bag of chips -- sorry, "crisps" -- that is so small and full of air that a light breeze would send it flying. And a drink is some type of bottled tea or juice because they don't drink water in this backwards country.<br />
What is wrong with brits. Seriously! £5 is like $6.25. The amount of options in America for that price, that are not only more filling but also *hot*, is astounding. And this is something they're *proud* of! They think this is the ultimate in luxury and price! I can get a rotisserie chicken for that price. And that's just if I, like the british, were demented enough to buy my lunch from a grocery store every day. I could hit up a grocery store salad bar for that price and get a huge box of greens and stuff!<br />
So, they have bad food opinions here. Maybe that's why they characterize us as fat -- we just have better food and so an incentive to actually eat.
