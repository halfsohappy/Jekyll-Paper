Annabel (Annie) Lee is a tryhard from Duke University who made this website even though the assignment really only necessitated a google doc. She did this because she felt insecure about the fact that she wasn't majoring in Theater Studies like most members of Duke in London - Arts. She thought that if she used Computer Science, something she actually is majoring in, then it would make up for being less knowledgeable about theater. Whether this is working remains to be seen.
